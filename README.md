This repository stores scripts used to install software optimized for the cluster named Misha, which is part of the core facility overseen by the Center for Neurocomputation and Machine Intelligence of the Wu Tsai Institute.  

Misha primarily utilizes EasyBuild to install the majority of its software packages. However, some key applications, such as PyTorch, are built from the source code targeted to specific hardware used on the cluster.
